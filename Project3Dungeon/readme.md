## Running the jar file

The jar can be run in 2 modes - 
1. GUI mode
```
   java -jar 'absolute path to jar file/*.jar'
```
Example: java -jar PATH/Project3Dungeon.jar

2. Running in Text based mode -
```
    java -jar 'absolute path to jar file/*.jar' wrapping noRows noColumns interconnectivity 
    percentageOfCaveContainingTreasue noOfMonster

   When running the program, you need to specify following in the given order-
   wrapping -> {1 - Non-wrapping / 2 - wrapping} -> Determines if the dungeonmodel is wrapped
   noRows -> {4 <= n <= 2147483648} - > Determines the number of rows
   noColumns -> {4 <= n <= 2147483648} - > Determines the number of columns
   interconnectivity -> {0 <= n <= 2147483648} -> Determines interconnectivity
   percentageOfCaveContainingTreasue -> {0 <= n <= 100} -> Percentage of caves containing treasure.
   noOfMonster -> {1 <= n <= noOfCaves} -> Numeric value representing the number of monster present in the dungeonmodel.
```
Example: java -jar PATH/Project3Dungeon.jar 1 4 6 0 30 3

## Design Changes
1. Divided the UI panel into more modular parts-
   1. A panel to display Instructions.
   2. A penal to display current score and game state.
   3. A panel containing the maze.
2. Used command pattern for Pick, Move and Shoot function, thus allowing greater flexibility.
3. Read the game instructions from a text file, so one can update it with ease.

## Assumptions
1. When the interconnectivity is specified more than the maximum possible connections the 
   dungeon will be a fully open dungeon.
2. When the value for number of monsters in dungeon is entered more than the number of caves, 
   each cave will have a monster(except the start) and the remaining additional monster count 
   will be neglected. 
3. No weapons will be added at the destination cave as there is
   no point collecting a weapon after reaching the destination.
4. The player must compulsorily kill the Otyugh at the end cave to win

## Limitations

1. The game may sometimes lag due to the use to legacy tools.
